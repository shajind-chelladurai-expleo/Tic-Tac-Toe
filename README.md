# Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic Tac Toe is traditionally played on a n × n ( where n is always odd , primarily n=3) grid. Players take turns placing a mark in one of the cells of the grid. The goal of the game is for players to position their marks so that they make a continuous line of three cells vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
